        There is a lack of systematic quantitative information about the social and economic situation of Bhutan for the 1970s.
         The baselines for historical comparison available today were first collected in 1985 – the year when time series data was collected.
          Some information that date back to 1974 indicate the low base of infrastructure that existed at that time. 
          There were 11 ill-equipped hospitals,
         manned mostly by foreign doctors, and 45 basic health units in 1974, the year Jigme Singye's coronation was held.

        In his Coronation Address on 2 June 1974, Jigme Singye stressed the need "to attain self-reliance and
         preserve Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence." He also stressed that any development 
          should be a genuine collaboration between the people and the government. During the 1970s, immediate aims for rural 
          households unfolded in terms of intensive valley projects, cash crops cultivation, especially potatoes – irrigation, 
          and resettlement. Enhancing the income and livelihood of the rural people were the main focus of the 3rd and 4th FYPs.
           Soon after he acceded to the throne, Jigme Singye launched the Trashigang and Tsirang Intensive Valley Development
            Projects in 1972.
         These projects were part of a larger vision of food self-sufficiency and income generation.
